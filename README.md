# Workflow Overview

This Nextflow pipeline identifies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels from paired-end FASTQ files of an organism of interest.
The workflow is designed to streamline the analysis and includes the following steps:
* Fetches the reference genome and indexes with BWA it for efficient alignment.
* Downloads short-read paired sequence data and aligns them to the reference genome with BWA.
* Performs quality control analysis on all paired FASTQ files with FastQC.
* Converts alignments (`.sam`) to compressed format (`.bam`) with samtools.
* Removes PCR duplicates with samtools to improve variant-calling accuracy.
* Identifies SNVs and indels with BCFtools from processed alignment data.
* Generates index files (`.bai`) with BCFtools for visualization of alignment and variant data in IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer).
